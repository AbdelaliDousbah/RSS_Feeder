# My Fancy Terminal RSS Feeder

This project is a Ruby-based command-line RSS feeder. It fetches and displays the latest news articles from an RSS feed. Users can input a custom RSS feed URL or use the default New York Times Africa RSS feed. The project utilizes Ruby and the 'rss' and 'open-uri' libraries to provide a simple way to stay updated with news headlines.

You can try it out on Replit by following this link: [RSS Feed Reader on Replit](https://replit.com/@AbdelaliDousbah/RSS-feed-reader).
